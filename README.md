# African-Food-Production-and-Supply--2004-2013

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW
Food production and supply play an important role in providing nutrition and promoting economic growth in Africa.Food security includes the availability, usability, stability, and affordability of food for both people and communities.Human well-being, societal stability, poverty reduction, and sustainable development all rely on food security.

In this project, I will be analyzing two different datasets namely food production and food supply datasets.The dataset was sourced from Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations website.The two datasets have information about food production and food supply in 45 African countries between (2004 - 2013) respectively.The Population and Country code dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

### PROJECT GOAL
The goal of of this project is to analyze these datasets, and gain insights on African food shortage problems, and producing visuals that can help in making appropriate decisions and ensuring food security in Africa.

### Dataset Features
Food Production Dataset:

1.Country: The name of the country.

2.Item: The name of the produce from each country.

3.Year: The year of production.

4.Value: The quantity of each item, measured in kilotonnes (kt).

Food Supply Dataset:

1.Country: The name of the country.

2.Year: The year of supply.

3.Value: The quantity supplied, measured in kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/day).

### INSIGHTS FROM THE ANALYSIS
1.Food production in Africa increases yearly. However, apart from the drop in 2007, there was a progress increase in food production from 2008 to 2013.

2.There is a progressive increase in food supply in African countries from 2004 to 2013.

3.The TOP 3 African countries with the highest volume of food production within (2004-2013) are Nigeria, Egypt, & South Africa. However, the BOTTOM 3 African countries Cabo Verde, Sao Tome & Principe and Djibouti produced the least volume of food.

4.The TOP 3 African countries with the highest volume of food supply within (2004-2013) are Egypt, Tunisia, & Morocco. However, the BOTTOM 3 African countries Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia supplied the least volume of food..

5.The Top 5 most produced food in Africa between 2004 and 2013 are Cassava, Sugar Cane, Maize and products, Yam, and Vegetables.

6.The Least 5 most produced food in Africa between 2004 and 2013 are Cloves, Molluscs,Pepper, Fish,Liver oil and Aquatic Animals.

7.Among the Top 3 African producing countries:

Nigeria highest food produces are Cassava and its products & Yams.The reason for this high production in these two categories could be attributed to the ease of cultivating and producing these crops in Nigeria.The combination of favorable climatic conditions, cultural preferences, and relatively straightforward cultivation methods contributes to Nigeria's high production of Cassava and Yams.

Egypt highest food produces is Sugarcane although there is a relatively fair spread in their food production including Products like Maize & Products, Tomatoes, Vegetables, Wheat, Milk (excluding butter) unlike Nigeria.

South Africa highest food produces is SugarCane and Maize.

8.39 countries in total produced consistently high amount of food between 2004 and 2013 and they are regarded as outlier countries. This Country include (Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).

9.Egypt is the African country with highest food supply outliers because the supply value is higher than the upper fence value. It is also evident from the Visualization that Egypt has a substantially bigger food supply accessible for consumption in 2012 compared to other African countriess.

10.In 2007, the average food production dropped to 305.2158kt and the average food supplied was 2447.75kcal/person/day this means that more food was supplied to meet the need of the population. This situation highlights the fact that food production alone does not determine the availability of food for a population. There is a need for African Countries to improve their food productions capacities and reduce dependence on external sources of food.

11.The Top 5 Cassava Producing Countries that has the highest total quantity of Oats from 2004 to 2013 are: Algeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, Morrocco, and Kenya. However, Algeria is the top leading producer of Oat products.

12.The Top 5 Cassava Producing Countries that has the highest total quantity of Cassava from 2004 to 2013 are: Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Mozambique, and United Republic of Tanzania. However, Nigeria is the top leading producer of Cassava.

13.The Top 5 Producing Countries that has the highest total quantity of Beverage from 2004 to 2013 are: Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, and Cameroon. However, Nigeria is the top leading producer of beverage.

14.The Top 5 countries that have produced the highest total quantity of rice from 2004 to 2013 are: Egypt, Nigeria, Madagascar, United Republic of Tanzania, and Guinea. However, Egypt is the top leading producer of Rice.

15.The correlation hypothesis shows a significant positive relationship between rice production and African countries population during a specific year, the small p value shows that the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected at the 5% level. The correlation coefficient "0.97" shows a strong relationship between average rice production each year and average African population size in the same year. However, despite a significant relationship between population and rice production, correlation doesn't imply causation. This does not necessarily imply that rice production is what causes population growth.

#### Conclusion:
According to the Hypothesis testing, there was a bit significant relationship between population, food supply, and production in Africa between 2004 and 2013. Between 2004 and 2013, African countries experienced a potential food shortage due to a low food supply compared to increased production of food and population.

However, the population doesn't seem to explain the possible cause of the food shortage in Africa during this time other elements like price inflation, exports, and inadequate storage facilities may be reasons for the shortage because countries with high food production have smaller food supply compared to their production.

African countries must embark on a more deliberate transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture, this will enhance both the food supply and the countries total GDP. It will also help Africa country decrease or eradicate global hunger.
